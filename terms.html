      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <dl class="definition-list">
        <dt>“FlowFix”</dt>
        <dd>The plumbing and drainage service, which may connect customers with independent engineers or send an employed engineer.</dd>
        <dt>“Customer”</dt>
        <dd>The person requesting plumbing or drainage assistance.</dd>
        <dt>“Engineer”</dt>
        <dd>The attending plumber or drainage specialist, whether employed by FlowFix or acting as an independent contractor.</dd>
        <dt>“Service”</dt>
        <dd>Any plumbing or drainage attendance provided by an Engineer following a booking with FlowFix.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Our Role</h2>
      <p>FlowFix may send an employed Engineer or introduce an independent Engineer who provides the Service under a separate contract directly between the Customer and that Engineer. FlowFix is not the merchant of record for work carried out by independent Engineers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Quotes &amp; Website Pricing</h2>
      <p>Any prices shown on the FlowFix website are typical, indicative examples only and do not constitute a binding quote. Actual pricing may vary based on factors such as access, parts required, time of day, location and complexity. The Engineer will confirm the price with the Customer before or during attendance wherever possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>All payments for the Service are made directly to the Engineer. FlowFix may receive a referral or marketing fee from the Engineer, but does not process payments for Services carried out by independent Engineers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Call-Out &amp; Attendance Fees</h2>
      <p>Call-out fees and any other charges are set by FlowFix or the attending Engineer. Fees may apply where, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A cancellation occurs after an Engineer has been dispatched.</li>
        <li>The Engineer cannot gain safe access to the property or Customer.</li>
        <li>Site conditions are unsafe or unsuitable to complete the job.</li>
        <li>Details supplied are inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
        <li>The plumbing or drainage issue differs materially from the description provided.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Cancellations &amp; No-Shows</h2>
      <p>To cancel, contact FlowFix or the attending Engineer using the details provided at the time of booking. Late cancellations or no-shows after dispatch may incur charges, including call-out or attendance fees.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>Any refunds are handled directly by FlowFix or the attending Engineer in line with their policies. FlowFix can assist with routing refund requests to the appropriate Engineer but may not control or process refunds for independent Engineers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Liability &amp; Complaints</h2>
      <p>The Engineer is responsible for performing the Service. FlowFix is not liable for an independent Engineer’s performance, timing, or any loss or damage arising from the Service. We will, however, assist in escalating concerns where possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Customer Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate and complete information about the issue, property, access, and condition.</li>
        <li>Ensure safe access for the Engineer, including providing instructions for isolation points where known.</li>
        <li>Advise of any hazards, water supply risks, or unusual conditions that may affect plumbing or drainage work.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Availability</h2>
      <p>FlowFix aims to offer emergency attendance 24/7, but availability is not guaranteed and depends on Engineer capacity, weather, major incidents, and geographic coverage.</p>
    </section>
