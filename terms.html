      <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
      <p>FlowFix Plumbing provides plumbing and drainage services directly to customers. These terms set out how we work, what you can expect, and what we ask of you.</p>
      <p class="small-note"><strong>Business details (to be completed by client):</strong> Legal name, trading name (if different), contact email, phone number, correspondence address.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p>FlowFix Plumbing (“FlowFix”, “we”, “our”) provides plumbing and drainage diagnosis, repairs, replacements, and related works directly. We may use employees or subcontractors under our control and standards to deliver the service.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Quotes/Estimates</h2>
      <p>Prices shown on this site or given by phone are guide estimates. Final costs depend on factors such as access, time on site, materials, time of day, and complexity. We confirm pricing with you before work begins, and no work starts without your approval.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Call-out/Diagnosis Fee</h2>
      <p>If a call-out or diagnosis fee applies, it will be confirmed before we dispatch. The fee covers travel to site and initial assessment/make-safe. It may be offset against further work at our discretion. <strong>To be completed by client:</strong> confirm whether a call-out fee applies and the current amount.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Appointments &amp; Cancellations</h2>
      <p>We aim to attend within agreed windows. If you cancel after an engineer is en route, or if access is unavailable, a call-out or cancellation charge may apply to cover time and travel.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>Payment is due upon completion of the agreed works unless stated otherwise. We accept the payment methods advised by the attending engineer. Parts remain our property until paid for in full.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Warranty/Workmanship</h2>
      <p>We warrant our labour for a defined period from completion, excluding consumables, wear and tear, misuse, or unrelated system faults. <strong>To be completed by client:</strong> specify the warranty duration and any exclusions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Liability Limits</h2>
      <p>We act with reasonable skill and care. We are not liable for indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, or delays caused by factors outside our control (e.g., traffic, supplier delays, unsafe conditions). Nothing limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Complaints</h2>
      <p>If you are unhappy with our service, contact us using the details above. We will investigate and aim to resolve issues promptly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-card">
      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of England &amp; Wales. Any disputes will be handled by the courts of England &amp; Wales.</p>
